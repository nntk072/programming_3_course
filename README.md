This is the Tampere University course of Interfaces and Techniques by applying in Java. More information can be found from this website: https://sis-tuni.funidata.fi/student/courseunit/otm-7729fb27-72e9-4e35-ba75-590fd2fc1999/brochure

Each exercise in each round can be considered as each project since the workload is large. There are some specific exercises:
01. StudentRegister + Sodoku (round4) -> Class hierarchy, inheritance, exception handling, comparing objects
02. Wordgame (round5) -> Inner classes
03. Comparison (round6) -> Maven, Dependency
04. Country data (JSON) + JSON countries (round7) -> JSON, Maven, Dependency, xml
05. Movie data (streams + streams2) (round8) -> Streams, Lambda functions
06. Javadocson (round10) -> Javadoc, Comments
07. Unit testing (round11) -> JUnit, Unit testing
08. JavaFX Wordle (round12) -> JavaFX, FXML
09. Sisu unraveled (round project) -> JavaFX, FXML, JSON, VersionControl, Javadoc, Lambda functions, Streams: https://github.com/nntk072/SISU_GUI.git

Basic contents of each directory:

round3: Java as Programming Language (Basic concept of Java, about input, output streams, containers, sorting and lambda functions)
round4: Programming in the large  (Java classes, packages, Exception handling)
round5: Inheritance (Applying inheritance and exeption handling)
round6: Class Hierarchies (Interfaces, Abstract Base Class, Multiple Inheritance)
round7: Packages (Appylying packages and handling JSON files)
round8: Generics (generics, functional interfaces)
round10: Work Distribution and Working in a Team (Applying and using VersionControl, JSON & Javadoc)
round 11: Functional Program (Unit Testing, Lambda functions, Streams)
round 12: Graphical User Interfaces (JavaFX, FXML)
round 13, 14, 15, 16 (round project): Sisu unraveled (update later)
